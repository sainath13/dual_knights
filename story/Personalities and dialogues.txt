# Character Personalities

## Flame Knight
Proud, hotheaded, and impatient. Speaks in dramatic, chivalric terms but often loses composure when frustrated. Has a rivalry with Aqua Knight but secretly respects them.

## Aqua Knight
Calm, methodical, and slightly sardonic. More strategic than Flame Knight. Enjoys pointing out ironies and making dry observations. Uses water-related metaphors.

## Regular Barrels
Mischievous troublemakers who think they're more fearsome than they are. Speak in explosive puns and take joy in creating chaos. Love taunting knights.

## Moving Barrels
Even more cocky than regular barrels. Think they're superior because they can move. Have a swagger to their personality and love to show off their mobility.

## Archer
Professional and disciplined. Takes their job very seriously. Speaks formally but occasionally makes dry observations about the knights' attempts.
